# Contributing to @takk/modelchain

Thanks for considering a contribution. This document is the canonical guide for proposing changes to `@takk/modelchain`.

The project is open source under [Apache License 2.0](../LICENSE). The package surface and stability promise are documented in [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md); the live roadmap and deferred work are in [TASK.md](../TASK.md).

## 1. Code of conduct

Be respectful, be precise, and assume good faith. The maintainer reads every issue and PR personally; disrespectful, harmful, or manipulative behavior is grounds for removal from the project. The full policy is in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## 2. Contributor license

Every contribution is governed by the Apache License 2.0 (the same license the project is published under). Sign off every commit with `git commit -s` (Developer Certificate of Origin):

```bash
git commit -s -m "fix(retrier): cap retry-after at maxDelayMs"
```

The `-s` flag appends a `Signed-off-by:` trailer that attests you have the right to submit the change under Apache 2.0. PRs without DCO sign-off are not merged. Substantive features additionally fall under the [Contributor License Agreement](../CLA.md).

## 3. Local setup

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- **Node 20, 22, or 24.** CI runs the matrix; pick one for local dev. `.nvmrc` pins the LTS line.
- **pnpm 10.** The repo uses `pnpm` for install and scripts and pins `pnpm@10.34.1` in `packageManager`. `npm` and `yarn` also work but `pnpm-lock.yaml` is the source of truth.
- **git** with `git commit -s` configured (DCO).

### 3.2 Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davccavalcante/modelchain.git
cd modelchain
pnpm install
```

### 3.3 Verify locally

```bash
pnpm verify          # lint + typecheck + test + build + publint
# or run individually:
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm build
pnpm publint
pnpm attw
pnpm size
```

Current baseline (verify before opening a PR): **182 tests passing across 12 suites**. Coverage `lines 76.04% / statements 75.37% / functions 79.90% / branches 59.77%`.

## 4. Branch and commit conventions

### 4.1 Branch names

- `fix/<short-slug>` - bug fixes
- `feat/<short-slug>` - new optional surface (minor bump)
- `docs/<short-slug>` - README/SPEC/CHANGELOG-only changes
- `chore/<short-slug>` - tooling, deps, CI
- `refactor/<short-slug>` - internal restructuring with no API change

Avoid PRs larger than ~500 LOC; split into smaller logically-coherent PRs.

### 4.2 Commit style

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) are encouraged but not enforced. What IS enforced:

- **One commit per logical change.** No `WIP` or `fixup` commits in the merged history.
- **Imperative subject up to 70 chars.** Body wrap at 72 cols.
- **DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`).**
- **No commit credits to AI assistants.** This is the Creator's discipline.

### 4.3 What requires a discussion before coding

Open a GitHub Issue first if your change touches:

- New public export (SemVer minor/major impact - see [SPEC.md §5](../SPEC.md#5-stability-promise)).
- New telemetry event kind.
- The persisted `StateSnapshot` schema written by `FileStateBackend`.
- The CLI flags or subcommands.
- The `ProviderAdapter`, `RoutingStrategy`, `ScoringStrategy`, or `StateBackend` interface.

For docs-only fixes, typos, or contained internal refactors, skip the issue and open a PR directly.

## 5. Pull request workflow

### 5.1 Before opening

- All checks green: `pnpm verify` (plus `pnpm attw` and `pnpm size`).
- Coverage thresholds preserved or improved (see `vitest.config.ts`).
- For any change that touches the public API: `SPEC.md` and `README.md` updated.
- For any deprecated surface: `@deprecated` JSDoc + a `### Deprecated` section in the next `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

### 5.2 PR description

Fill the [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) honestly. Empty sections are not acceptable; write "N/A" with a one-line reason if a section truly does not apply.

### 5.3 Review

The maintainer reviews every PR personally. Expect:

- Surgical line-by-line read.
- Question on intent before merge (Creator's discipline: "if you notice any problem, error, or inconsistency, ask before acting").
- Required for governance-touching changes: explicit Creator approval before merge.

### 5.4 After merge

CI publishes nothing on merge to `main`. Publishing is a Creator-triggered two-step flow: Step 1 (`release.yml`) creates the reviewable GitHub Release; Step 2 (`npm-publish.yml`) publishes to npm with provenance after review (see [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md)).

---

## 6. Tests

Add tests for any non-trivial change. Patterns:

- **Vitest** (`tests/**/*.test.ts`). Unit tests in `tests/unit/`, end-to-end routing in `tests/integration/`, and the SemVer-locked routing decisions in `tests/golden/routing.test.ts`. One file per surface area. Deterministic seeds for randomness; mock `fetch` for HTTP paths.
- **Live smoke** (`tests/live/route-smoke.ts`) runs against a real provider key from `.env`; it NEVER logs raw keys or full responses and is not part of the offline CI run.
- **No reliance on real provider credentials** in CI. Tests run offline.

Every fix-able bug ships with a regression test that fails pre-fix and passes post-fix.

---

## 7. Security disclosure

Do NOT open a public GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities. Email `davcavalcante@proton.me` with the prefix `[SECURITY]` and we will coordinate fix + disclosure timeline privately. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.

---

## 8. Releasing

Releases are maintainer-only. The full runbook lives in [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md). Contributors do not tag, do not publish, do not edit historical CHANGELOG entries (those are immutable per Keep a Changelog).

When proposing a change that warrants a release, indicate in your PR description which SemVer bump you believe it triggers (patch / minor / major per [SPEC.md §5.2](../SPEC.md#52-semver-policy)). The maintainer makes the final call.

---

## 9. Communication

- **GitHub Issues** for bug reports + feature requests (see [ISSUE_TEMPLATE/](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE)).
- **GitHub Discussions** (if enabled) for design conversations.
- **Email** `davcavalcante@proton.me` for anything private, sensitive, or trademark/licence-related.

The project's primary language for code, docs, CI, issues, and PRs is **English**. Use English in PR descriptions and code comments.
